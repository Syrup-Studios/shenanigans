This is our attempt at creating a nice and pleasant Vanilla++ Experience with many opinionated changes to make it feel very comfortable and familiar.

- Overhauled Biomes — Discover new surface biomes, along with cave biomes & cool features!
- Deeper and Darker — Do you wonder what is beneath the bedrock? Maybe it's time to find out.
- Custom Structures — Reimagined vanilla structures for the best experience !
- Backpacks — Don't run out of inventory slots while you're out exploring!
- New Animals — It looks like it’s time to build a zoo with new animals !
- Ambient Sounds — Be surrounded by new sounds which will make everything feel so immersive!
- More Blocks — Build your dream house using more block variations !
- Photography — Capture memories with a functioning camera!
- Expanded Farming and cooking — Cook new dishes and do farming-related things!
- Expanded Archaeology — Dig into archaeology with new tools and items to uncover fossils !
- Magic — Some lightweight magic elements that don't feel out of place !
- Controller in mind — We want this to be as controller-friendly as possible! (WIP)

We want to bring all mods and additions together in a way that feels natural, and make it as straightforward as possible, so that new players have an easy time getting into modded MC!

This pack has been in the works for over 2 years (LOTS of procrastination), and I'm finally wanting to bring it to light to make it the gameplay experience I envisioned so long ago.
